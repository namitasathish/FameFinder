# FameFinder
This ML project uses TensorFlow and MobileNet V2 to train a model that recognize faces from images, trained with over 2500+ images with a high accuracy
 training a neural network model, and predicting facial expressions. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled face images and achieves an accuracy of 74.27%. It leverages transfer learning to enhance accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications in recognizing and categorizing facial expressions

# Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle and consists of images stored in two directories:
- **Faces:** Pre-processed images of faces.
- **Original Images:** The original images containing faces.
